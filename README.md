```
usage: dac.py [-h] [-x] [-v] [-p PROXIES]

Discord Account Creator (custom discriminator, raid, spam, etc) + proxies

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -x, --x               go through list only once and exit
  -v, --verbose         increase output verbosity
  -p PROXIES, --proxies PROXIES
                        custom proxy list (ip:port\n)
```

_another example_: `python3 proxyfish.py > proxies.txt;`**`python3 dac.py -xp proxies.txt`**

(bypass more captchas with fresh proxies or something like 2captcha)

`import multiprocessing to continue`

PoC, someone add multithreading and I'll finish it.

###### this is for educational purposes only. i may have heard of something called discord "nitro" to choose your own custom discriminator and more as discord probably disapproves (especially registering accounts, not even temp ephemerals to claim if id is true)
