discord account creator // async + proxies

```
usage: dac.py [-h] [-x] [-v] [-t THREADS] [-p PROXIES]

discord account creator // async + proxies

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -x, --x               go through list only once and exit
  -v, --verbose         increase output verbosity
  -t THREADS, --threads THREADS
                        number of threads (default: 5)
  -p PROXIES, --proxies PROXIES
                        custom proxy list (ip:port\n)
```

_another example_: 

`while :; do python3 `[`proxyfish.py`](https://github.com)` > proxies.txt; `**`python3 dac.py -xp proxies.txt`**`; done`


(custom discriminator, raid, spam, etc)

(bypass more captchas with fresh proxies or something like 2captcha)

PoC. todo: add async or threading

###### this is for educational purposes only. i may have heard of something called discord "nitro" to choose your own custom discriminator and more as discord probably disapproves (especially registering accounts, not even temp ephemerals to claim if id is true)
